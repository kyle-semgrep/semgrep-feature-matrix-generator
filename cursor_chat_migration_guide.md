# Porting Cursor AI Chats from Desktop to Mobile/Web

## Current Situation

**Important Note**: As of 2025, Cursor AI **does not have an official mobile app or web version** that syncs chat data with the desktop application. Cursor is primarily a **desktop-only AI code editor** based on VS Code.

## What You Can Do: Export Your Desktop Chats

Since there's no direct sync capability, your best option is to **export your chat conversations** from the desktop app and then manually access them on other devices. Here are the available methods:

### Method 1: Use the SpecStory Extension (Recommended)
The most user-friendly option is to install the **SpecStory extension** for Cursor:

1. **Install the Extension**:
   - Go to the VS Code Marketplace
   - Search for "SpecStory (Cursor Extension)"
   - Install it in your Cursor editor

2. **Export Your Chats**:
   - Use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Search for "SpecStory" commands
   - Export your chats to Markdown, HTML, or JSON format

3. **Access on Other Devices**:
   - Save the exported files to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
   - Access them from any device with a web browser

### Method 2: Manual Database Export
For more technical users, you can directly access Cursor's chat database:

#### On Windows:
```bash
cd %APPDATA%\Cursor\User\workspaceStorage
```

#### On macOS:
```bash
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage
```

#### On Linux:
```bash
cd ~/.config/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage
```

#### Extract Chat Data:
1. **Find the Database Files**:
   - Look for folders with MD5 hash names
   - Each contains a `state.vscdb` file (SQLite database)

2. **Query the Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT 
   rowid,
   [key],
   value
   FROM ItemTable
   WHERE [key] IN ('aiService.prompts', 'workbench.panel.aichat.view.aichat.chatdata')
   ```

3. **Use Tools Like**:
   - **Datasette**: `datasette state.vscdb` (then visit localhost:8001)
   - **DB Browser for SQLite**: GUI tool for viewing SQLite files

### Method 3: Third-Party Export Tools

Several community-created tools can help export Cursor chats:

#### Python Scripts:
- **cursor-chat-export** (GitHub: somogyijanos/cursor-chat-export)
- **cursor-chat-browser** (GitHub: thomas-pedersen/cursor-chat-browser)

#### Usage Example:
```bash
# Clone a tool
git clone https://github.com/somogyijanos/cursor-chat-export.git
cd cursor-chat-export

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Export chats
python chat.py export --output-dir "/path/to/output"
```

### Method 4: Cursor Convo Export Extension (Paid)
There's also a paid extension called "Cursor Convo Export" available for purchase that provides:
- Export to Markdown or HTML
- Command Palette integration
- Timestamped file exports

## Alternative Solutions

### 1. Use Cloud-Based Code Editors
Consider using cloud-based alternatives that offer better cross-device sync:
- **GitHub Codespaces**
- **Replit**
- **CodeSandbox**
- **Gitpod**

### 2. Document Important Conversations
For critical conversations:
1. **Copy and paste** important chats into a note-taking app
2. Use tools like **Notion**, **Obsidian**, or **Google Docs**
3. Organize by project or topic for easy retrieval

### 3. Screen Recording/Screenshots
For visual reference:
- Take screenshots of important conversations
- Use screen recording tools to capture complex interactions
- Store in organized folders by project

## Limitations to Be Aware Of

### No Official Sync
- Cursor doesn't offer cloud sync for chat history
- No official mobile app exists
- Web version doesn't exist with chat functionality

### Chat Storage Location
- Chats are stored locally per workspace
- Each project has its own chat database
- Moving between devices requires manual export

### Data Format Complexity
- Chat data is stored in SQLite format
- JSON structure can be complex to parse
- Timestamps may need conversion

## Best Practices for Cross-Device Access

### 1. Regular Exports
- Export chats weekly or after important sessions
- Use automated scripts if you're technical
- Store exports in organized cloud folders

### 2. Standardized Naming
```
Project_Name_Chat_Export_YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

### 3. Cloud Storage Organization
```
/Cursor_Exports/
  /Project_A/
    /2025-01-15_chat_export.md
    /2025-01-20_chat_export.md
  /Project_B/
    /2025-01-18_chat_export.md
```

### 4. Use Version Control
- Commit chat exports to your project repositories
- Include in documentation folders
- Tag important conversation milestones

## Future Possibilities

### What Cursor Might Add:
- Cloud sync for chat history
- Web-based interface
- Mobile companion app
- Cross-device project continuity

### Current Alternatives:
- **VS Code** with GitHub Copilot (has some sync features)
- **JetBrains IDEs** with AI assistants
- **Cloud-based coding platforms**

## Summary

While Cursor doesn't currently support direct chat syncing between desktop and mobile/web, you can:

1. **Use the SpecStory extension** for easy exports
2. **Manually export chat databases** for technical users
3. **Organize exports in cloud storage** for cross-device access
4. **Consider alternative platforms** if cross-device sync is critical

The community has created several tools to help with this limitation, and it's likely that Cursor will add official sync features in the future as the platform evolves.

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Install SpecStory extension** in Cursor
2. **Export chats regularly** (weekly or after important sessions)
3. **Save to cloud storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
4. **Access exported files** from any device via web browser
5. **Keep organized folder structure** for easy navigation

This approach gives you the best cross-device access to your Cursor AI conversations until official sync features are available.
