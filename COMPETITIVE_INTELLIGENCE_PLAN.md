# Semgrep Competitive Intelligence Feature - Implementation Plan

## üéØ Project Overview

Enhance the Semgrep Feature Matrix Generator to include competitive intelligence capabilities, allowing sales teams to generate comparison matrices that show how Semgrep stacks up against selected competitors across programming languages and SCM platforms.

## üìã Core Requirements

### User Experience Flow
1. User selects desired languages and SCMs (existing functionality)
2. User optionally enables "Include Competitive Intelligence" 
3. User selects which competitors to include in analysis
4. Generated output includes:
   - Standard Semgrep feature matrix (existing)
   - Language comparison table for each competitor
   - SCM support matrix across all selected competitors
   - Executive summary of competitive advantages

### Technical Requirements
- Follow existing pattern of JSON-based data storage
- Gather data from official sources only (no hallucinations)
- Include source URLs and timestamps for all data
- Implement proper error handling and data validation
- Maintain existing automated update patterns

## üè¢ Phase 1: Competitor Identification & Research

### Proposed Initial Competitor Set
Based on market research, these are Semgrep's primary competitors:

1. **Checkmarx** - Enterprise SAST leader
2. **Veracode** - Application security platform  
3. **SonarQube/SonarCloud** - Code quality + security
4. **Snyk** - Developer-first security platform
5. **CodeQL/GitHub Advanced Security** - GitHub's native solution
6. **Fortify** (Micro Focus) - Enterprise SAST solution

### Research Methodology
- **Primary Sources**: Official documentation, product pages, GitHub repositories
- **Verification**: Cross-reference multiple sources
- **Documentation**: Include source URLs and last-updated timestamps
- **Scope**: Focus on publicly available information only

## üìä Phase 2: Data Structure Design

## üñ•Ô∏è Phase 3: UI Implementation

### Form Enhancements
- Add "Include Competitive Intelligence" checkbox after SCM selection
- When enabled, show multi-select dropdown for competitors
- Add form validation for competitive analysis selections
- Update existing form styling to accommodate new fields

### UI Mockup (Text)
```
[Existing form fields...]

‚òê Include Competitive Intelligence
    ‚Ü≥ Select Competitors:
      ‚òê Checkmarx
      ‚òê Veracode  
      ‚òê SonarQube
      ‚òê Snyk

## üìà Phase 4: Output Generation

### New Output Components

#### 1. Language Comparison Tables
For each selected competitor, generate a table showing:
- All user-specified languages
- SAST cross-file analysis support (‚úÖ/‚ùå)
- SCA reachability analysis support (‚úÖ/‚ùå)  
- Unsupported languages highlighted in red
- Semgrep advantages called out in green

#### 2. SCM Support Matrix
Single table with:
- Selected competitors across columns
- Selected SCMs down rows
- Green checkmarks (‚úÖ) for supported
- Red X marks (‚ùå) for unsupported
- Semgrep column for comparison

#### 3. Executive Summary
- Key competitive advantages for Semgrep
- Language coverage comparison
- Unique differentiators
- Areas where prospects should focus

### Sample Output Structure
```

## üîß Phase 5: Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Data Loading (`load_competitors.py`)
```python
def load_competitor_data():
    """Load all competitor JSON files"""
    
def get_competitor_list():
    """Return list of available competitors"""
    
def validate_competitor_data():
    """Ensure data integrity"""
```

#### 2. Generation Logic (`generate_cheatsheet.py`)
```python
def generate_competitive_analysis():
    """Generate competitive comparison tables"""
    
def create_language_comparison():
    """Create per-competitor language tables"""
    
def create_scm_matrix():
    """Create SCM support matrix"""
    
def generate_executive_summary():
    """Create sales talking points"""
```

#### 3. Web Interface (`web_interface.py`)
- Add competitor selection handling
- Update form processing logic
- Extend template context with competitor data

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Form Enhancement (`templates/web_interface_template.html`)
- Add competitive intelligence section
- Implement dynamic competitor selection
- Update form validation JavaScript

#### 2. Output Templates
- Extend existing templates with competitive sections
- Add styling for comparison tables
- Implement color coding for advantages/disadvantages

## üîÑ Phase 6: Data Maintenance Strategy

### Automated Updates
Follow existing pattern with new scripts:
- `enrich_competitors_with_docs.py` - Update competitor data
- GitHub Action workflow for monthly competitor data refresh
- Smart change detection with notifications

### Manual Review Process
- Quarterly accuracy reviews
- Source validation and updates
- Competitive landscape monitoring

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Mitigation

### Data Accuracy
- **Solution**: Use only official sources, document everything
- **Validation**: Include source URLs and timestamps
- **Updates**: Regular data refresh workflows

### Legal Compliance  
- **Scope**: Public information only
- **Attribution**: Proper source documentation
- **Disclaimers**: Clear data source and freshness indicators

### Maintenance Overhead
- **Automation**: Follow existing update patterns
- **Monitoring**: Track data freshness and accuracy
- **Scaling**: Start with core competitors, expand gradually

## üéØ Success Metrics

### Sales Team Usage
- Percentage of matrices generated with competitive analysis
- Most frequently compared competitors
- User feedback on usefulness

### Data Quality
- Source freshness (avg age of data)
- Accuracy validation results  
- Update frequency compliance

## ‚ùì Key Questions for Stakeholder Review

### 1. Competitor Scope
- **Question**: Should we focus on these 6 initial competitors, or do you have specific ones your sales team encounters most?
- **Impact**: Determines research scope and initial data collection effort

### 2. Technical Capabilities 
- **Question**: Beyond SAST cross-file and SCA reachability, what other capabilities matter in competitive battles?
- **Options**: IAST, DAST, container scanning, IaC scanning, custom rules, etc.
- **Impact**: Defines data schema and comparison table structure

### 3. Sales Team Priorities
- **Question**: What are the most important competitive battlegrounds?
- **Options**: Language support, enterprise features, developer experience, deployment options, pricing
- **Impact**: Determines executive summary focus and key differentiators

### 4. Data Maintenance
- **Question**: How often should competitive data be refreshed?
- **Options**: Monthly automated, quarterly manual, ad-hoc
- **Impact**: Automation complexity and resource requirements

### 5. Output Complexity
- **Question**: Simple ‚úÖ/‚ùå indicators or more nuanced scoring?
- **Impact**: Template complexity and data collection depth

### 6. Legal Review
- **Question**: Do you need legal review of competitive analysis output?
- **Impact**: Implementation timeline and approval process

### 7. Priority Languages
- **Question**: Should we prioritize research for languages where Semgrep is strongest or faces most competition?
- **Impact**: Research effort allocation and data quality focus
