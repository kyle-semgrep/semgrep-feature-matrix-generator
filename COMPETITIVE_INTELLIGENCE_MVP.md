## 🔍 Competitive Intelligence Focus Areas

### 1. SAST Cross-file Dataflow Analysis
**What it is:** Advanced static analysis that tracks data flow across multiple files and functions to detect complex security vulnerabilities.

**Competitive Landscape:**
- ✅ **Semgrep:** Strong cross-file analysis capabilities
- ✅ **Checkmarx:** Advanced dataflow analysis across files  
- ✅ **Veracode:** Cross-file taint analysis
- ✅ **Snyk:** Interfile analysis (except Ruby)
- ✅ **GitHub Advanced Security:** CodeQL provides sophisticated cross-file analysis
- ✅ **SonarQube:** Advanced taint analysis with library code analysis

### 2. SCA Reachability Analysis  
**What it is:** Determines if vulnerable code paths in dependencies are actually reachable/used by your application, reducing false positives.

**Competitive Landscape:**
- ❌ **Semgrep:** Not currently available (key opportunity!)
- ✅ **Checkmarx:** Reachability analysis for open source vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Veracode:** Reachability insights for dependency prioritization
- ✅ **Snyk:** Industry-leading reachability analysis
